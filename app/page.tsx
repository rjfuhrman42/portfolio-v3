          <p>
            Iâ€™m Reid Fuhrman, a software engineer based in Brooklyn, New York.
            I&apos;m passionate about helping people building beautiful, useful
            things on the web. Most recently i&apos;ve had the privelege of
            working at Township, a design and development agency where I was
            exposed to a wide variety of clients from varying industries and
            helped bring their products to life.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>My main focus today is continuing to grow my frontend
            expertise while actively seeking out opportunities to learn and grow
            my backend skillset.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>While not coding, you can find me practicing guitar,
            cooking a new recipe in my wok, or riding my fixed gear bike through
            the (terrifying(fun)) streets of NYC.
